## Current Sprint (P0 - Critical)

### 1. Complete TODO placeholders in generator.py [WSJF: 8.0]
**Impact**: Critical - Generated tests currently have placeholder TODOs instead of proper assertions
**Effort**: Small (3 story points)
**Risk**: High - Core functionality incomplete

**Tasks**:
- Replace "# TODO: assert expected result" with actual assertions
- Replace "// TODO: expect result" with proper test expectations
- Replace "// TODO: call {m} and assert" with method calls and assertions
- Add proper result validation for all language generators

### 2. Implement proper test assertions in generated tests [WSJF: 11.0]
**Impact**: Critical - Core value proposition depends on quality test generation
**Effort**: Small (2 story points)
**Risk**: High - Tests without assertions provide no value

**Tasks**:
- Analyze function return types and generate appropriate assertions
- Add edge case validation logic
- Implement mock verification for complex scenarios

### 3. Add input validation to CLI commands [WSJF: 5.2]
**Impact**: High - Security and reliability improvement
**Effort**: Medium (5 story points) 
**Risk**: High - CLI currently accepts unvalidated user input

**Tasks**:
- Validate file paths and directory existence
- Sanitize configuration file inputs
- Add schema validation for JSON configs
- Implement proper error messages for invalid inputs

### 4. Add comprehensive error handling [WSJF: 4.4]
**Impact**: High - Improves user experience and debugging
**Effort**: Medium (5 story points)
**Risk**: Medium - Current error handling is minimal

**Tasks**:
- Add try-catch blocks around file operations
- Implement graceful failure for LLM API calls
- Add user-friendly error messages
- Log errors with context for debugging

## Next Sprint (P1 - High Priority)

### 5. Add parameterized test support to quality scorer [WSJF: 3.2]
**Impact**: Medium - Enhances quality analysis accuracy
**Effort**: Medium (5 story points)
**Risk**: Low - Enhancement to existing functionality

### 6. Add structured logging throughout codebase [WSJF: 2.4]
**Impact**: Medium - Improves observability and debugging
**Effort**: Large (8 story points)
**Risk**: Low - Infrastructure improvement

### 7. Implement multiprocessing for coverage analysis [WSJF: 2.25]
**Impact**: Medium - Performance improvement for large projects
**Effort**: Large (8 story points)
**Risk**: Medium - Concurrency complexity

### 8. Implement caching layer for performance [WSJF: 2.0]
**Impact**: Medium - Speed improvements for repeated operations
**Effort**: Large (8 story points)
**Risk**: Low - Performance optimization

## Future Sprints (P2 - Medium Priority)

### 9. Implement streaming for large project analysis [WSJF: 1.15]
**Impact**: Low-Medium - Handles edge case of very large projects
**Effort**: Extra Large (13 story points)
**Risk**: Medium - Complex implementation

## Technical Debt Items

### High Priority
- Generator.py has 7 TODO placeholders that prevent proper test generation
- CLI lacks input validation and sanitization
- Error handling is minimal throughout the codebase
- Generated tests lack meaningful assertions

### Medium Priority  
- No structured logging for debugging and monitoring
- Performance bottlenecks in coverage analysis for large projects
- Quality scorer doesn't handle parameterized tests
- No caching mechanism for repeated operations

### Low Priority
- Memory usage could be optimized for very large projects
- Code could benefit from more comprehensive type hints
- Some modules lack comprehensive unit test coverage

## Definition of Done Criteria

For each task:
- [ ] Implementation completed with proper error handling
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing (>90% coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests updated if applicable
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] Code review approved
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline passes
- [ ] Manual testing completed

## Risk Assessment

**High Risk**:
- TODO placeholders in core generator functionality
- Lack of input validation creates security vulnerabilities
- Missing assertions make generated tests worthless

**Medium Risk**:
- Performance issues with large codebases
- Incomplete error handling affects user experience

**Low Risk**:
- Missing observability features
- Optimization opportunities
