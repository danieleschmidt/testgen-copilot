## COMPLETED WORK

### âœ… 1. Complete TODO placeholders in generator.py [WSJF: 8.0] - COMPLETED
**Impact**: Critical - Generated tests now have proper assertions instead of placeholders
**Effort**: Small (3 story points)
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED

**Completed Tasks**:
- âœ… Replaced "# TODO: assert expected result" with intelligent assertions
- âœ… Replaced "// TODO: expect result" with proper test expectations
- âœ… Replaced "// TODO: call {m} and assert" with actual method calls
- âœ… Added return type analysis for smart assertion generation
- âœ… Added comprehensive test coverage for assertion generation

**Results**: Generator now produces meaningful tests with proper type-based assertions across all supported languages.

### âœ… 2. Add input validation to CLI commands [WSJF: 5.2] - COMPLETED  
**Impact**: High - Significantly improved security and reliability
**Effort**: Medium (5 story points)
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED

**Completed Tasks**:
- âœ… Added path security validation to prevent system file access
- âœ… Implemented configuration schema validation with security checks
- âœ… Added numeric argument validation (coverage/quality targets, poll intervals)
- âœ… Enhanced error messages with detailed type information
- âœ… Added comprehensive test coverage for all validation scenarios

**Results**: CLI now blocks dangerous paths, validates all inputs, and provides clear error messages.

## Current Sprint (P0 - Critical)

### âœ… 4. Add comprehensive error handling [WSJF: 4.4] - COMPLETED
**Impact**: High - Significantly improved user experience and debugging capabilities
**Effort**: Medium (5 story points)
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED

**Completed Tasks**:
- âœ… Added comprehensive try-catch blocks around all file operations
- âœ… Implemented graceful failure handling for security scanner, coverage analyzer, and quality scorer
- âœ… Added user-friendly error messages with detailed context
- âœ… Integrated structured logging with debug, info, warning, and error levels
- âœ… Created comprehensive test suite for error handling scenarios
- âœ… Enhanced all modules with proper exception handling and validation

**Results**: All modules now handle file I/O errors, syntax errors, encoding issues, and invalid paths gracefully with informative error messages and proper logging.

## Current Sprint (P0 - Critical)

### ðŸ”„ 1. Add parameterized test support to quality scorer [WSJF: 3.2] - NEXT PRIORITY
**Impact**: Medium - Enhances quality analysis accuracy
**Effort**: Medium (5 story points)
**Risk**: Low - Enhancement to existing functionality

**Tasks**:
- Detect pytest.mark.parametrize decorators in test analysis
- Update quality scoring to account for parameterized test patterns
- Add support for data-driven test recognition
- Enhance test quality metrics with parameterized test coverage

## Next Sprint (P1 - High Priority)

### 5. Add parameterized test support to quality scorer [WSJF: 3.2] - MOVED TO P0
**Impact**: Medium - Enhances quality analysis accuracy
**Effort**: Medium (5 story points)
**Risk**: Low - Enhancement to existing functionality

### 6. Add structured logging throughout codebase [WSJF: 2.4]
**Impact**: Medium - Improves observability and debugging
**Effort**: Large (8 story points)
**Risk**: Low - Infrastructure improvement

### 7. Implement multiprocessing for coverage analysis [WSJF: 2.25]
**Impact**: Medium - Performance improvement for large projects
**Effort**: Large (8 story points)
**Risk**: Medium - Concurrency complexity

### 8. Implement caching layer for performance [WSJF: 2.0]
**Impact**: Medium - Speed improvements for repeated operations
**Effort**: Large (8 story points)
**Risk**: Low - Performance optimization

## Future Sprints (P2 - Medium Priority)

### 9. Implement streaming for large project analysis [WSJF: 1.15]
**Impact**: Low-Medium - Handles edge case of very large projects
**Effort**: Extra Large (13 story points)
**Risk**: Medium - Complex implementation

## Technical Debt Items

### High Priority
- Generator.py has 7 TODO placeholders that prevent proper test generation
- CLI lacks input validation and sanitization
- Error handling is minimal throughout the codebase
- Generated tests lack meaningful assertions

### Medium Priority  
- No structured logging for debugging and monitoring
- Performance bottlenecks in coverage analysis for large projects
- Quality scorer doesn't handle parameterized tests
- No caching mechanism for repeated operations

### Low Priority
- Memory usage could be optimized for very large projects
- Code could benefit from more comprehensive type hints
- Some modules lack comprehensive unit test coverage

## Definition of Done Criteria

For each task:
- [ ] Implementation completed with proper error handling
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing (>90% coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests updated if applicable
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] Code review approved
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline passes
- [ ] Manual testing completed

## Risk Assessment

**High Risk**:
- TODO placeholders in core generator functionality
- Lack of input validation creates security vulnerabilities
- Missing assertions make generated tests worthless

**Medium Risk**:
- Performance issues with large codebases
- Incomplete error handling affects user experience

**Low Risk**:
- Missing observability features
- Optimization opportunities
