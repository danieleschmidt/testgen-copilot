## COMPLETED WORK

### âœ… 1. Complete TODO placeholders in generator.py [WSJF: 8.0] - COMPLETED
**Impact**: Critical - Generated tests now have proper assertions instead of placeholders
**Effort**: Small (3 story points)
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED

**Completed Tasks**:
- âœ… Replaced "# TODO: assert expected result" with intelligent assertions
- âœ… Replaced "// TODO: expect result" with proper test expectations
- âœ… Replaced "// TODO: call {m} and assert" with actual method calls
- âœ… Added return type analysis for smart assertion generation
- âœ… Added comprehensive test coverage for assertion generation

**Results**: Generator now produces meaningful tests with proper type-based assertions across all supported languages.

### âœ… 2. Add input validation to CLI commands [WSJF: 5.2] - COMPLETED  
**Impact**: High - Significantly improved security and reliability
**Effort**: Medium (5 story points)
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED

**Completed Tasks**:
- âœ… Added path security validation to prevent system file access
- âœ… Implemented configuration schema validation with security checks
- âœ… Added numeric argument validation (coverage/quality targets, poll intervals)
- âœ… Enhanced error messages with detailed type information
- âœ… Added comprehensive test coverage for all validation scenarios

**Results**: CLI now blocks dangerous paths, validates all inputs, and provides clear error messages.

## Current Sprint (P0 - Critical)

### âœ… 4. Add comprehensive error handling [WSJF: 4.4] - COMPLETED
**Impact**: High - Significantly improved user experience and debugging capabilities
**Effort**: Medium (5 story points)
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED

**Completed Tasks**:
- âœ… Added comprehensive try-catch blocks around all file operations
- âœ… Implemented graceful failure handling for security scanner, coverage analyzer, and quality scorer
- âœ… Added user-friendly error messages with detailed context
- âœ… Integrated structured logging with debug, info, warning, and error levels
- âœ… Created comprehensive test suite for error handling scenarios
- âœ… Enhanced all modules with proper exception handling and validation

**Results**: All modules now handle file I/O errors, syntax errors, encoding issues, and invalid paths gracefully with informative error messages and proper logging.

### âœ… 5. Add parameterized test support to quality scorer [WSJF: 3.2] - COMPLETED
**Impact**: Medium - Significantly enhanced quality analysis accuracy
**Effort**: Medium (5 story points)
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED

**Completed Tasks**:
- âœ… Implemented detection of pytest.mark.parametrize decorators with multiple import patterns
- âœ… Enhanced quality scoring to properly count parameterized test functions
- âœ… Added comprehensive support for data-driven test recognition with loop analysis
- âœ… Created detailed quality metrics including parameterized and data-driven test counts
- âœ… Implemented support for multiple parametrize decorators on single functions
- âœ… Added comprehensive test suite covering all parameterized test scenarios
- âœ… Maintained backward compatibility while enhancing functionality

**Results**: Quality scorer now accurately detects and analyzes parameterized tests, providing detailed metrics on test function counts vs. actual test case counts, improving quality assessment accuracy.

## Current Sprint (P0 - Critical)

### âœ… 6. Add structured logging throughout codebase [WSJF: 2.4] - COMPLETED
**Impact**: Medium - Significantly improved observability and debugging capabilities
**Effort**: Large (8 story points)
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED

**Completed Tasks**:
- âœ… Implemented centralized logging configuration with StructuredLogger class
- âœ… Added JSON and structured text formatting options
- âœ… Created LogContext for operation tracking with correlation IDs
- âœ… Integrated performance timing logs with duration measurement
- âœ… Added comprehensive error logging with structured context
- âœ… Implemented audit and metrics logging capabilities
- âœ… Enhanced generator module with structured logging and context tracking
- âœ… Updated CLI module with operation-level logging context
- âœ… Added log rotation and configurable destinations
- âœ… Created comprehensive test suite for logging functionality

**Results**: Complete structured logging system now provides detailed observability with correlation tracking, performance metrics, error context, and configurable output formats. All operations are now tracked with structured context for improved debugging and monitoring.

### âœ… 7. Implement multiprocessing for coverage analysis [WSJF: 2.25] - COMPLETED
**Impact**: Medium-High - Significant performance improvement for large projects
**Effort**: Large (8 story points)
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED

**Completed Tasks**:
- âœ… Implemented ParallelCoverageAnalyzer class with configurable worker processes

The implementation includes progress reporting, error handling with sequential fallback, and maintains full compatibility with existing CLI and API interfaces. Testing shows successful parallel processing of multiple files with consistent results compared to sequential analysis.

## Next Sprint (P1 - High Priority)

### 8. Implement caching layer for performance [WSJF: 2.0]
**Impact**: Medium - Speed improvements for repeated operations
**Effort**: Large (8 story points)

### 9. Implement streaming for large project analysis [WSJF: 1.15]
**Impact**: Low-Medium - Handles edge case of very large projects
**Effort**: Extra Large (13 story points)
**Risk**: Medium - Complex implementation

## Technical Debt Items

### High Priority
- Generator.py has 7 TODO placeholders that prevent proper test generation
- CLI lacks input validation and sanitization
- Error handling is minimal throughout the codebase
- Generated tests lack meaningful assertions

### Medium Priority  
- No structured logging for debugging and monitoring
- Performance bottlenecks in coverage analysis for large projects
- Quality scorer doesn't handle parameterized tests
- No caching mechanism for repeated operations

### Low Priority
- Memory usage could be optimized for very large projects
- Code could benefit from more comprehensive type hints
- Some modules lack comprehensive unit test coverage
