# TestGen-Copilot Project Charter

## Executive Summary

TestGen-Copilot is an intelligent CLI tool and VS Code extension that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically generate comprehensive unit tests and identify security vulnerabilities across multiple programming languages.

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- **Automated Test Generation**: Unit tests, integration tests, edge cases, and error path testing
- **Security Vulnerability Detection**: OWASP Top 10, input validation, injection attacks
- **Multi-Language Support**: Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Java, C#, Go, Rust
- **IDE Integration**: Native VS Code extension with real-time suggestions
- **Coverage Analysis**: Code coverage tracking and reporting
- **Quality Assessment**: Test quality scoring and metrics
- **CI/CD Integration**: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins compatibility

### Out of Scope
- Manual test execution (tool generates tests, doesn't run them)
- Production deployment security monitoring
- Performance testing beyond basic benchmarks
- Non-code artifact testing (databases, infrastructure)

## Business Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Reduce Development Time**: Automate 80% of test creation work
2. **Improve Code Quality**: Achieve 85%+ test coverage across projects
3. **Enhance Security**: Early detection of vulnerabilities in development
