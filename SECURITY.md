## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of TestGen Copilot Assistant seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### How to Report

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please send an email to security@testgen.dev with the following information:

- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact
- Any suggested fixes (if available)

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

### What to Expect

- We will respond to your report within 48 hours
- We will provide an initial assessment within 5 business days
- We will work with you to understand and validate the vulnerability
- We will develop and test a fix
- We will coordinate the release of the fix
- We will publicly acknowledge your contribution (if desired)

## Security Measures

### Code Security

- **Static Analysis**: All code undergoes static security analysis using Bandit and Semgrep
- **Dependency Scanning**: Dependencies are regularly scanned for known vulnerabilities using Safety and pip-audit
- **Secret Detection**: We use TruffleHog and GitLeaks to prevent secrets from being committed
- **Code Review**: All code changes require review before merging

### Infrastructure Security

- **Container Scanning**: Docker images are scanned using Trivy and Grype
- **Minimal Attack Surface**: Production containers run with minimal privileges and non-root users
- **Network Security**: Services communicate over encrypted channels
- **Access Control**: Principle of least privilege is enforced

### Data Protection

- **No Data Retention**: TestGen does not store user code or generated tests
- **Local Processing**: Code analysis happens locally unless explicitly configured otherwise
- **API Key Security**: API keys are never logged or stored in plaintext
- **Secure Transmission**: All API communications use HTTPS/TLS

### Operational Security

- **Regular Updates**: Dependencies and base images are updated regularly
- **Security Monitoring**: Automated monitoring for security events
- **Incident Response**: Documented procedures for security incident response
- **Backup Security**: Secure backup and recovery procedures

## Security Best Practices for Users

### API Key Management

1. **Never commit API keys** to version control
2. **Use environment variables** to store sensitive configuration
3. **Rotate API keys regularly**
4. **Use separate keys** for development and production
5. **Monitor API key usage** for anomalies

### Configuration Security

1. **Review configuration files** before committing
2. **Use the principle of least privilege** for tool permissions
3. **Regularly update** TestGen to the latest version
4. **Monitor tool output** for sensitive information leaks

### Network Security

1. **Use HTTPS** for all API communications
2. **Configure firewalls** appropriately
3. **Use VPN** when accessing from untrusted networks
4. **Monitor network traffic** for anomalies

## Vulnerability Management Process

### Discovery

Vulnerabilities may be discovered through:
- Security research and responsible disclosure
- Automated vulnerability scanning
- Dependency vulnerability databases
- User reports
- Internal security audits

### Assessment

When a vulnerability is reported:

1. **Triage**: Initial assessment within 48 hours
2. **Validation**: Confirm the vulnerability exists
3. **Scoring**: Assign severity using CVSS 3.1
4. **Impact Analysis**: Assess potential impact on users

### Response

Based on severity:

- **Critical (9.0-10.0)**: Fix within 24 hours
- **High (7.0-8.9)**: Fix within 72 hours  
- **Medium (4.0-6.9)**: Fix within 1 week
- **Low (0.1-3.9)**: Fix in next regular release

### Communication

- **Private disclosure** to reporter
- **Public advisory** after fix is available
- **Security advisory** on GitHub Security tab
- **Release notes** with security fixes highlighted

## Security Tools and Automation

### Continuous Security

- **Pre-commit hooks** prevent secrets from being committed
- **CI/CD pipelines** include security scanning at every stage
- **Automated dependency updates** with security prioritization
- **Regular security audits** of the entire codebase

### Monitoring and Alerting

- **Security event monitoring** in production
- **Vulnerability database monitoring** for new threats
- **Automated security scanning** on schedule
- **Alert escalation** for critical issues

## Compliance and Standards

### Security Standards

- **OWASP Top 10**: Regular assessment against web application security risks
- **CWE/SANS Top 25**: Prevention of most dangerous software weaknesses
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Adherence to cybersecurity best practices

### Privacy

- **GDPR Compliance**: Minimal data collection and processing
- **Privacy by Design**: Security and privacy built into the development process
