## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in TestGen Copilot Assistant, please report it responsibly:

### Private Reporting (Preferred)

1. **GitHub Security Advisories**: Use the [GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/testgen-team/testgen-copilot-assistant/security/advisories) feature to report vulnerabilities privately.

2. **Email**: Send an email to `security@testgen.dev` with:
   - A detailed description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Any suggested fixes or mitigations

### What to Include

Please provide as much information as possible:

- **Vulnerability Type**: (e.g., code injection, privilege escalation, data exposure)
- **Affected Components**: Which parts of the system are affected
- **Attack Vector**: How the vulnerability can be exploited
- **Impact**: What an attacker could achieve
- **Proof of Concept**: Minimal example demonstrating the issue
- **Environment**: OS, Python version, package version

### Response Timeline

We are committed to responding to security reports promptly:

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours of receiving the report
- **Investigation**: We will investigate and validate the report within 5 business days
- **Fix Development**: Critical vulnerabilities will be patched within 7 days
- **Disclosure**: Public disclosure will occur after a fix is available

### Security Bug Bounty

While we don't currently offer a formal bug bounty program, we recognize and credit security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities.

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest version of TestGen Copilot Assistant
2. **Secure Configuration**: Follow our configuration guidelines
3. **Environment Isolation**: Run in isolated environments when analyzing untrusted code
4. **API Key Security**: Protect your LLM API keys and use environment variables
5. **Review Generated Code**: Always review AI-generated tests before using them

### For Developers

1. **Secure Development**: Follow OWASP guidelines and security best practices
2. **Dependency Management**: Regularly update dependencies and scan for vulnerabilities
3. **Code Review**: All changes require security-focused code review
4. **Testing**: Include security tests in your test suite
5. **Static Analysis**: Use security scanning tools in your CI/CD pipeline

## Security Features

### Built-in Security Measures

1. **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
2. **Path Traversal Protection**: File operations are restricted to allowed directories
3. **Resource Limits**: Memory and execution time limits prevent resource exhaustion
4. **Secure Defaults**: Conservative security settings by default
5. **Dependency Scanning**: Regular vulnerability scanning of dependencies

### Security Scanning

TestGen Copilot Assistant includes security scanning capabilities:

```bash
# Run security scan on your codebase
testgen generate --security-scan --file your_file.py

# Security-focused analysis
testgen analyze --security-rules owasp-top-10 --project .
```

### Supported Security Rules

- **Injection Attacks**: SQL injection, command injection, code injection
- **Authentication Issues**: Weak authentication, session management
- **Data Exposure**: Sensitive data leakage, insecure data storage
- **Cryptographic Issues**: Weak encryption, poor key management
- **Input Validation**: Missing or inadequate input validation
- **Access Control**: Authorization bypass, privilege escalation

## Known Security Considerations

### AI Model Interactions

- **Prompt Injection**: Be aware that malicious code in input files could potentially influence AI model responses
- **Data Privacy**: Code sent to external AI services may be stored or processed by third parties
- **Model Limitations**: AI-generated security assessments should be verified by human experts

### File System Access

- TestGen requires read access to source files and write access to test directories
- Use appropriate file permissions and run with minimal required privileges
- Consider using Docker containers for additional isolation

### Network Communications

- Outbound HTTPS connections to AI service providers
- Optional telemetry data transmission (can be disabled)
- Dependency downloads during installation

## Compliance and Standards

### Industry Standards

- **OWASP**: Following OWASP Top 10 and secure coding practices
- **NIST**: Alignment with NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- **CWE**: Common Weakness Enumeration coverage in security rules
- **CVSS**: Using Common Vulnerability Scoring System for risk assessment

### Data Handling

- **Privacy by Design**: Minimal data collection and processing
- **Data Minimization**: Only necessary data is processed
- **Retention**: Temporary data is cleaned up after processing
- **Encryption**: Sensitive data encrypted in transit and at rest

## Security Monitoring

### Automated Scanning

Our CI/CD pipeline includes:

- **SAST**: Static Application Security Testing with Bandit
- **Dependency Scanning**: Vulnerability scanning with Safety
- **Container Scanning**: Docker image vulnerability assessment
- **Secret Scanning**: Prevention of credential leaks

### Continuous Monitoring

- **Dependency Updates**: Automated dependency update checks
- **Security Advisories**: Monitoring for security advisories affecting our dependencies
- **Threat Intelligence**: Staying informed about emerging security threats

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Process

1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring and user reports
2. **Assessment**: Evaluate the severity and impact
3. **Containment**: Immediate steps to limit exposure
4. **Investigation**: Detailed analysis of the incident
5. **Resolution**: Fix implementation and testing
6. **Communication**: Notify affected users and stakeholders
7. **Post-Incident**: Review and improve security measures

### Communication Channels
