2. **Path Traversal Protection**: File operations are restricted to allowed directories
3. **Resource Limits**: Memory and execution time limits prevent resource exhaustion
4. **Secure Defaults**: Conservative security settings by default
5. **Dependency Scanning**: Regular vulnerability scanning of dependencies

### Security Scanning

TestGen Copilot Assistant includes security scanning capabilities:

```bash
# Run security scan on your codebase
testgen generate --security-scan --file your_file.py

# Security-focused analysis
testgen analyze --security-rules owasp-top-10 --project .
```

### Supported Security Rules

- **Injection Attacks**: SQL injection, command injection, code injection
