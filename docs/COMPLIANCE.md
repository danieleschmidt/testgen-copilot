# Compliance Framework Documentation

This document outlines the compliance framework and security standards implemented in the TestGen Copilot project.

## Overview

TestGen Copilot follows industry-leading security and compliance practices to ensure enterprise-grade reliability and security posture.

## Compliance Standards

### SLSA (Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts)

**Current Level**: SLSA Level 2 (Target: Level 3)

**Implemented Controls**:
- ✅ Source integrity: All code changes tracked in Git with signed commits capability
- ✅ Build integrity: Reproducible builds using containerized environments
- ✅ Dependency tracking: Comprehensive SBOM generation and vulnerability scanning
- ✅ Build provenance: Automated build processes with audit trails

**Implementation Status**:
- [x] Build system integrity
- [x] Source control integration
- [x] Automated dependency scanning
- [ ] Cryptographic signing of artifacts (Planned)
- [ ] Build attestation verification (Planned)

### SOC 2 Type II Readiness

**Security Principles Addressed**:

**Availability**:

**Security**:
- Multi-layered security scanning (SAST, DAST, dependency)
- Secrets management and rotation
- Access control and authentication

**Confidentiality**:
- Data encryption in transit and at rest
- Secure credential storage
- Privacy-by-design architecture

**Processing Integrity**:
