# GitHub Workflows Setup

**⚠️ MANUAL SETUP REQUIRED**: Due to GitHub security restrictions, workflow files cannot be automatically created. Please manually create these workflows in your repository.

## Required Workflows

The following workflow files need to be created in `.github/workflows/`:

### 1. CI Pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

**Purpose**: Comprehensive continuous integration with multi-version testing, quality checks, and security scanning.

**Features**:
- Multi-Python version testing (3.8-3.12)
- Code quality checks (ruff, mypy, bandit)
- Container security scanning with Trivy
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Coverage reporting to Codecov

### 2. Security Scanning (`.github/workflows/security.yml`)

**Purpose**: Advanced security analysis and vulnerability detection.

**Features**:
- CodeQL static analysis
- Semgrep SAST scanning
- OSV vulnerability scanning
- SBOM generation and attestation
- Supply chain security monitoring

### 3. Performance Testing (`.github/workflows/performance.yml`)

**Purpose**: Performance monitoring and load testing automation.

**Features**:
- Automated benchmarking
- Memory profiling
- Load testing with Locust
- Performance regression detection

### 4. Release Pipeline (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)

**Purpose**: Secure and automated release management.

**Features**:
- Comprehensive pre-release validation
- Security scanning of release artifacts
- Automated PyPI publishing
- GitHub release creation with artifacts

## Setup Instructions

1. **Navigate to your repository on GitHub**
2. **Go to `.github/workflows/` directory**
3. **Create each workflow file manually**
4. **Copy the content from the generated files in this repository**
5. **Commit and push the workflows**

## Workflow Sources

The complete workflow files are available in this repository at:
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- `.github/workflows/security.yml`
- `.github/workflows/performance.yml`
- `.github/workflows/release.yml`

## Required Secrets

Configure these secrets in your repository settings:

### For Release Workflow
- `PYPI_API_TOKEN`: PyPI publishing token
- `TEST_PYPI_API_TOKEN`: Test PyPI token (optional)

### For Coverage Reporting
- `CODECOV_TOKEN`: Codecov integration token

## Repository Settings

### Branch Protection Rules
Recommended settings for `main` branch:
- Require pull request reviews
- Require status checks to pass
- Require branches to be up to date
- Require signed commits
- Include administrators

### Security Settings
- Enable Dependabot security updates
- Enable Dependabot version updates
- Enable private vulnerability reporting
- Configure code scanning alerts

## Validation

After setting up workflows:

1. **Create a test PR** to verify CI pipeline
2. **Check security tab** for scan results
3. **Monitor actions tab** for workflow execution
4. **Review branch protection** compliance

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Workflow permission errors**:
   - Grant necessary permissions in workflow files
   - Configure repository secrets properly

2. **Security scan failures**:
   - Review scan results and address findings
   - Update exclusion rules if needed

3. **Performance test failures**:
   - Ensure test environment is properly configured
   - Adjust performance thresholds as needed

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the Actions tab for detailed error logs
2. Review workflow file syntax
3. Consult GitHub Actions documentation
4. Open an issue in this repository

**Note**: These workflows represent best practices for a MATURING repository (50-75% SDLC maturity). They provide comprehensive automation while maintaining security and quality standards.
