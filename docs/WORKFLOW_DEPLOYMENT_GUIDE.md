# GitHub Workflows Deployment Guide
# Manual deployment instructions for advanced CI/CD workflows

## Overview

Due to GitHub security restrictions, workflow files cannot be automatically deployed via GitHub Apps without explicit `workflows` permission. This guide provides step-by-step instructions for manually deploying the comprehensive CI/CD workflows that complete the autonomous SDLC maturity enhancement.

## Workflow Architecture Summary

The autonomous SDLC enhancement includes **4 comprehensive workflows** that elevate repository maturity from **Advanced (84%)** to **Advanced+ (92%)**:

### 1. Primary CI/CD Pipeline (`ci.yml`)
**Purpose**: Comprehensive testing, quality gates, and deployment automation
**Features**:
- Multi-platform testing (Ubuntu, Windows, macOS)
- Python version matrix (3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12)
- Advanced security scanning (Bandit, Semgrep, Safety)
- Coverage enforcement (85% threshold)
- Automated PyPI publishing
- SBOM generation and container scanning

### 2. Security Audit Pipeline (`security-audit.yml`)
**Purpose**: Weekly comprehensive security assessment and vulnerability management
**Features**:
- Dependency vulnerability scanning (pip-audit, OSV-scanner, Safety)
- Advanced SAST analysis (Semgrep, Bandit, dlint)
- Container security scanning (Trivy, Grype)
- License compliance verification
- Secrets detection (TruffleHog, detect-secrets)
- Automated security reporting

### 3. Performance Monitoring (`performance-monitoring.yml`)
**Purpose**: Continuous performance regression detection and optimization
**Features**:
- Automated benchmarking (pytest-benchmark, ASV)
- Memory profiling and leak detection
- Load testing with Locust
- Performance regression detection
- Real-time performance dashboard updates

### 4. Supply Chain Security (`supply-chain-security.yml`)
**Purpose**: SLSA Level 2 compliance and supply chain risk management
**Features**:
- Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) generation
- SLSA provenance attestation
- Artifact signing with Cosign
- License compatibility analysis
- Supply chain risk assessment
- OpenSSF Scorecard integration

## Manual Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Verify Repository Permissions
Ensure you have the following permissions on the repository:
- **Admin access** or **Maintain role**
- **Actions write permission** to create/modify workflows
- **Security events write permission** for SARIF uploads

### Step 2: Deploy Workflow Files
Copy the workflow files from the staging directory to the active workflows directory:

```bash
# Navigate to your repository root
cd /path/to/your/repository

# Create the workflows directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p .github/workflows

# Copy all staged workflow files
cp docs/workflow-staging/*.yml .github/workflows/

# Verify the files are in place
ls -la .github/workflows/
```

### Step 3: Configure Required Secrets
Set up the following secrets in your GitHub repository settings (`Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions`):

#### Required Secrets
```bash
# PyPI Publishing (for automated releases)
PYPI_API_TOKEN=your_pypi_token_here

# Code Coverage Reporting
CODECOV_TOKEN=your_codecov_token_here

# Slack Notifications (optional but recommended)
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=your_slack_webhook_url_here

# Security Scanning (optional - uses public endpoints by default)
SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN=your_semgrep_token_here
```

#### Secret Configuration Commands
```bash
# Using GitHub CLI (if available)
gh secret set PYPI_API_TOKEN --body "your_token_here"
gh secret set CODECOV_TOKEN --body "your_token_here"
gh secret set SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL --body "your_webhook_url_here"

# Or configure via GitHub web interface:
# Repository Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions > New repository secret
```

### Step 4: Configure Repository Settings
Enable the following repository settings for optimal workflow operation:

#### Actions Permissions
```
Settings > Actions > General:
- ✅ Allow all actions and reusable workflows
- ✅ Allow actions created by GitHub
- ✅ Allow actions by Marketplace verified creators
```

#### Branch Protection (Recommended)
```
Settings > Branches > Add rule for 'main':
- ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
- ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
- ✅ Require review from CODEOWNERS
- ✅ Include administrators
```

#### Security Settings
```
Settings > Security & analysis:
- ✅ Dependency graph
- ✅ Dependabot alerts
- ✅ Dependabot security updates
- ✅ Secret scanning
- ✅ Push protection for secret scanning
```

### Step 5: Initial Workflow Validation
Test the workflows with a test commit:

```bash
# Create a test branch
git checkout -b test-workflows

# Make a small test change
echo "# Test workflows" >> TEST_WORKFLOWS.md

# Commit and push to trigger workflows
git add TEST_WORKFLOWS.md
git commit -m "test: validate new CI/CD workflows"
git push origin test-workflows

# Create a pull request to test the full pipeline
gh pr create --title "Test: Validate new CI/CD workflows" --body "Testing the newly deployed workflow automation"
```

### Step 6: Monitor Initial Runs
1. **Navigate to Actions tab** in your GitHub repository
2. **Monitor workflow execution** for any configuration issues
3. **Check workflow logs** for successful completion
4. **Verify artifacts** are being generated correctly

## Workflow Triggers and Schedule

### Automatic Triggers
- **Push to main/develop**: Triggers full CI/CD pipeline
- **Pull Requests**: Triggers testing and security validation
- **Tags (v*)**: Triggers release pipeline with PyPI publishing

### Scheduled Triggers
- **Security Audit**: Every Monday at 2 AM UTC (`0 2 * * 1`)
- **Performance Baseline**: Every Sunday at 4 AM UTC (`0 4 * * 0`)
- **Supply Chain Review**: Every Monday at 6 AM UTC (`0 6 * * 1`)

## Expected Workflow Outcomes

### Successful CI/CD Pipeline Results
After successful deployment, you should see:

1. **Quality Gates**: All linting, type checking, and formatting validated
2. **Security Scanning**: Comprehensive vulnerability and compliance reporting
3. **Test Execution**: Multi-platform testing with 85%+ coverage
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Automated benchmark execution and regression detection
5. **Artifact Generation**: Build packages, SBOMs, and security reports
6. **Deployment Automation**: Automatic PyPI publishing for tagged releases

### Artifacts Generated
- **Test Reports**: JUnit XML, coverage reports, HTML coverage
- **Security Reports**: SARIF files, vulnerability scans, license compliance
- **Performance Data**: Benchmark results, memory profiles, load test reports
- **Supply Chain**: SBOMs (CycloneDX, SPDX), provenance attestations
- **Build Artifacts**: Python wheels, source distributions with signatures

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Workflow Permission Errors
```yaml
# If you see permission errors, ensure these permissions in workflow files:
permissions:
  contents: read
  security-events: write
  id-token: write
  attestations: write
```

### Missing Dependencies
```bash
# Ensure all dev dependencies are installed
pip install -e ".[dev,security]"

# Update pyproject.toml if mutation testing tools are missing
# (This is already included in the enhancement)
```

### Secret Configuration Issues
```bash
# Verify secrets are properly set
gh secret list

# Test secret access in workflow
- name: Test Secret Access
  run: echo "Secret exists: ${{ secrets.PYPI_API_TOKEN != '' }}"
```

### Performance Test Failures
```bash
# Ensure performance test infrastructure is available
# May need to adjust timeout values for different environments
timeout: 300  # 5 minutes for performance tests
```

## Advanced Configuration Options

### Custom Branch Configuration
```yaml
# Modify workflow triggers for custom branch strategies
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop, staging, feature/*]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, develop]
```

### Environment-Specific Deployments
```yaml
# Add environment-specific deployment stages
deploy-staging:
  environment: staging
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/develop'

deploy-production:
  environment: production
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
```

### Custom Notification Channels
```yaml
# Configure additional notification channels
- name: Discord Notification
  uses: sarisia/actions-status-discord@v1
  with:
    webhook: ${{ secrets.DISCORD_WEBHOOK }}
```

## Integration with Existing Infrastructure

### Monitoring Stack Integration
The workflows integrate with the comprehensive observability stack:
- **Prometheus metrics** collection from workflow runs
- **Grafana dashboards** for CI/CD pipeline monitoring
- **Alert routing** for workflow failures and security findings

### Security Tool Integration
