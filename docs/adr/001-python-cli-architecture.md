# ADR-001: Python CLI Architecture Decision

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to establish the foundational architecture for TestGen Copilot Assistant. The tool must support both command-line interface usage and future VS Code extension integration while maintaining high performance and extensibility.

## Decision
We will use Python as the primary language with a modular CLI architecture based on the following principles:

1. **Core Language**: Python 3.8+ for broad compatibility
2. **CLI Framework**: Built-in argparse for minimal dependencies
3. **Architecture Pattern**: Layered architecture with clear separation of concerns
4. **Packaging**: Modern Python packaging with pyproject.toml
5. **Extension Points**: Plugin-ready architecture for future enhancements

## Rationale

### Python Selection
- **Ecosystem**: Rich ecosystem for AI/ML, AST parsing, and testing tools
- **Performance**: Sufficient for code analysis tasks with optimization opportunities
- **Community**: Large developer community familiar with Python tooling
- **Libraries**: Excellent libraries for static analysis (ast, rope) and testing (pytest)

### CLI Architecture
- **Simplicity**: argparse provides robust argument parsing without external dependencies
- **Testability**: Command pattern enables easy unit testing of CLI operations
- **Extensibility**: Subcommand architecture allows organic growth of features
- **Standards**: Follows Unix CLI conventions and Python packaging standards

### Modular Design
- **Separation**: Clear boundaries between CLI, core logic, and utilities
- **Testing**: Each module can be independently tested
- **Reusability**: Core components can be reused in VS Code extension
- **Maintenance**: Easier to maintain and debug isolated components
TestGen Copilot Assistant needs to provide both a command-line interface and VS Code extension integration. We need to decide on the core architecture and technology stack.

## Decision
We will implement the core functionality as a Python CLI tool with the following architecture:

1. **Core Engine**: Python-based for robust AST parsing and LLM integration
2. **Modular Design**: Separate modules for generation, security, coverage, and quality
3. **VS Code Integration**: Language Server Protocol (LSP) bridge to Python backend
4. **Multi-language Support**: Extensible parser system for different programming languages

## Rationale

### Python as Core Language
- **AST Parsing**: Excellent built-in AST modules and third-party libraries
- **LLM Integration**: Rich ecosystem of AI/ML libraries and API clients
- **Cross-platform**: Native cross-platform support with pip distribution
- **Community**: Large developer community for open-source contributions

### Modular Architecture
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns reduces complexity
- **Testability**: Individual modules can be tested in isolation
- **Extensibility**: New features can be added without affecting existing code
- **Performance**: Selective loading of modules based on required functionality

### CLI-First Design
- **Flexibility**: Can be integrated into any development workflow
- **CI/CD Integration**: Easy integration with build pipelines
- **IDE Agnostic**: Core functionality works regardless of editor choice
- **Automation**: Scriptable for batch processing and automation

## Consequences

### Positive
- Rapid development with familiar tooling
- Easy onboarding for Python developers
- Rich ecosystem for static analysis and AI integration
- Strong testing capabilities with pytest
- Future VS Code extension can reuse core components

### Negative
- Performance limitations compared to compiled languages
- GIL restrictions for true parallelism (mitigated by multiprocessing)
- Dependency management complexity for distribution
- Potential startup time overhead

### Risks & Mitigations
- **Performance**: Use multiprocessing for parallelization, optimize hot paths
- **Dependencies**: Minimal required dependencies, optional features as extras
- **Distribution**: Multiple distribution methods (pip, standalone binaries)
- **Compatibility**: Support Python 3.8+ for wide compatibility

## Implementation Notes
- Use type hints throughout for better IDE support and documentation
- Implement comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring
- Design interfaces that can be easily wrapped for VS Code extension
- Plan for future async/await support for VS Code integration

## Alternatives Considered

### Go
- **Pros**: Better performance, single binary distribution, good CLI libraries
- **Cons**: Smaller ecosystem for AST parsing, less AI/ML tooling
- **Decision**: Rejected due to ecosystem limitations

### Node.js/TypeScript
- **Pros**: Great VS Code integration, large ecosystem, fast development
- **Cons**: Runtime dependency, less suitable for static analysis tools
- **Decision**: Rejected due to static analysis complexity

### Rust
- **Pros**: Excellent performance, memory safety, growing ecosystem
- **Cons**: Steeper learning curve, smaller community, longer development time
- **Decision**: Rejected due to development velocity requirements

- ADR-005: VS Code Extension Architecture

## Review Date
This decision should be reviewed in Q2 2025 when VS Code extension development begins.
- Robust foundation for complex code analysis
- Easy integration with existing Python development tools
- Strong ecosystem for testing and security analysis
- Clear upgrade path for AI/ML enhancements

### Negative
- Requires Python runtime on target systems
- Additional complexity for VS Code extension (requires Python bridge)
- Potential performance overhead for very large codebases

### Mitigation Strategies
- Provide standalone executable builds to eliminate Python dependency
- Implement caching and incremental processing for performance
- Use efficient AST parsing libraries and parallel processing where possible

## Implementation Notes
- Use `click` or `argparse` for CLI interface
- Implement plugin system for language-specific parsers
- Use `ast` module for Python parsing, language-specific parsers for others
- Structure code for easy packaging and distribution
