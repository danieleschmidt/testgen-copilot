# ADR-001: Python CLI Architecture Decision

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to establish the foundational architecture for TestGen Copilot Assistant. The tool must support both command-line interface usage and future VS Code extension integration while maintaining high performance and extensibility.

## Decision
We will use Python as the primary language with a modular CLI architecture based on the following principles:

1. **Core Language**: Python 3.8+ for broad compatibility
2. **CLI Framework**: Built-in argparse for minimal dependencies
3. **Architecture Pattern**: Layered architecture with clear separation of concerns
4. **Packaging**: Modern Python packaging with pyproject.toml
5. **Extension Points**: Plugin-ready architecture for future enhancements

## Rationale

### Python Selection
- **Ecosystem**: Rich ecosystem for AI/ML, AST parsing, and testing tools
- **Performance**: Sufficient for code analysis tasks with optimization opportunities
- **Community**: Large developer community familiar with Python tooling
- **Libraries**: Excellent libraries for static analysis (ast, rope) and testing (pytest)

### CLI Architecture
- **Simplicity**: argparse provides robust argument parsing without external dependencies
- **Testability**: Command pattern enables easy unit testing of CLI operations
- **Extensibility**: Subcommand architecture allows organic growth of features
- **Standards**: Follows Unix CLI conventions and Python packaging standards

### Modular Design
- **Separation**: Clear boundaries between CLI, core logic, and utilities
- **Testing**: Each module can be independently tested
- **Reusability**: Core components can be reused in VS Code extension
- **Maintenance**: Easier to maintain and debug isolated components

## Consequences

### Positive
- Rapid development with familiar tooling
- Easy onboarding for Python developers
- Rich ecosystem for static analysis and AI integration
- Strong testing capabilities with pytest
- Future VS Code extension can reuse core components

### Negative
- Performance limitations compared to compiled languages
- GIL restrictions for true parallelism (mitigated by multiprocessing)
- Dependency management complexity for distribution
- Potential startup time overhead

### Risks & Mitigations
- **Performance**: Use multiprocessing for parallelization, optimize hot paths
- **Dependencies**: Minimal required dependencies, optional features as extras
- **Distribution**: Multiple distribution methods (pip, standalone binaries)
- **Compatibility**: Support Python 3.8+ for wide compatibility

## Implementation Notes
- Use type hints throughout for better IDE support and documentation
- Implement comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring
- Design interfaces that can be easily wrapped for VS Code extension
- Plan for future async/await support for VS Code integration

## Alternatives Considered

### Go
- **Pros**: Better performance, single binary distribution, good CLI libraries
- **Cons**: Smaller ecosystem for AST parsing, less AI/ML tooling
- **Decision**: Rejected due to ecosystem limitations

### Node.js/TypeScript
- **Pros**: Great VS Code integration, large ecosystem, fast development
- **Cons**: Runtime dependency, less suitable for static analysis tools
- **Decision**: Rejected due to static analysis complexity

### Rust
- **Pros**: Excellent performance, memory safety, growing ecosystem
- **Cons**: Steeper learning curve, smaller community, longer development time
- **Decision**: Rejected due to development velocity requirements
