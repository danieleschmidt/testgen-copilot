# ADR-002: Testing Framework Selection

## Status
Accepted

## Context
TestGen Copilot Assistant requires a comprehensive testing strategy that includes unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. The testing framework must support the tool's core mission of generating high-quality tests while ensuring the tool itself is thoroughly tested.

## Decision
We will use **pytest** as the primary testing framework with the following supporting tools:

1. **pytest**: Core testing framework
2. **pytest-cov**: Coverage reporting
3. **pytest-xdist**: Parallel test execution
4. **pytest-mock**: Mocking capabilities
5. **hypothesis**: Property-based testing
6. **bandit**: Security testing

## Rationale

### pytest Selection
- **Flexibility**: Supports various testing patterns (unit, integration, functional)
- **Ecosystem**: Rich plugin ecosystem for specialized testing needs
- **Fixtures**: Powerful fixture system for test setup and teardown
- **Assertions**: Clean, readable assertion syntax
- **Discovery**: Automatic test discovery with minimal configuration
- **Reporting**: Excellent reporting capabilities with multiple output formats

### Supporting Tools
- **pytest-cov**: Industry standard for Python coverage reporting
- **pytest-xdist**: Essential for parallel execution of large test suites
- **pytest-mock**: Simplified mocking with pytest integration
- **hypothesis**: Property-based testing for edge case discovery
- **bandit**: Security vulnerability scanning for our security-focused tool

## Implementation Strategy

### Test Structure
```
tests/
├── unit/           # Fast, isolated tests
├── integration/    # Component interaction tests
├── e2e/           # End-to-end workflow tests
├── fixtures/      # Test data and setup
└── conftest.py    # Shared configuration
```

### Coverage Targets
- **Unit Tests**: >90% line coverage
- **Integration Tests**: >80% feature coverage
- **E2E Tests**: >70% workflow coverage
- **Overall**: >85% combined coverage

### Test Categories
1. **Unit Tests**: Individual function/class testing
2. **Integration Tests**: Module interaction testing
3. **Security Tests**: Vulnerability scanning and validation
4. **Performance Tests**: Benchmark and load testing
5. **Contract Tests**: API interface validation

## Consequences

### Positive
- Industry-standard testing approach familiar to Python developers
- Comprehensive coverage reporting and analysis
- Parallel execution reduces CI/CD pipeline time
- Property-based testing discovers edge cases automatically
- Security testing validates our security scanning capabilities

### Negative
- Additional complexity with multiple pytest plugins
- Potential test suite bloat without proper organization
- Learning curve for advanced pytest features
- Dependency management for testing-only packages

### Quality Gates
- All PRs must maintain or improve test coverage
- Security tests must pass before merge
- Performance tests must not regress beyond thresholds
- Integration tests must pass on all supported Python versions

## Configuration

### pytest.ini
```ini
[tool:pytest]
testpaths = tests
python_files = test_*.py *_test.py
python_functions = test_*
python_classes = Test*
addopts = 
    --cov=src
    --cov-report=term-missing
    --cov-report=xml
    --cov-fail-under=85
    -v
    --tb=short
markers =
    unit: Unit tests
    integration: Integration tests
    e2e: End-to-end tests
    security: Security tests
    performance: Performance tests
    slow: Slow tests
```

### Coverage Configuration
```ini
[coverage:run]
source = src
omit = 
    */tests/*
    */venv/*
    */__pycache__/*
    */setup.py

[coverage:report]
exclude_lines =
    pragma: no cover
    def __repr__
    raise AssertionError
    raise NotImplementedError
```

## Test Automation

### CI/CD Integration
- Run full test suite on every PR
- Parallel execution across multiple Python versions
- Coverage reporting to GitHub/GitLab
- Security scan integration
- Performance regression detection

### Local Development
- Pre-commit hooks run fast tests
- Watch mode for continuous testing
- IDE integration for test running
- Coverage highlighting in editors

## Alternatives Considered

### unittest
- **Pros**: Built into Python standard library, no external dependencies
- **Cons**: More verbose syntax, limited fixture support, fewer plugins
- **Decision**: Rejected due to limited ecosystem and verbosity

### nose2
- **Pros**: Successor to nose, good plugin system
- **Cons**: Less active development, smaller community, fewer plugins
- **Decision**: Rejected due to smaller ecosystem compared to pytest

### Robot Framework
- **Pros**: Keyword-driven testing, great for acceptance tests
- **Cons**: Overkill for unit testing, additional complexity
- **Decision**: Rejected as primary framework, may consider for E2E tests

## Future Considerations

### Property-Based Testing
- Implement hypothesis tests for core algorithms
- Use property-based testing for security vulnerability detection
- Generate test cases for edge conditions automatically

### Mutation Testing
- Consider mutmut for test quality assessment
- Validate that tests actually catch bugs
- Ensure comprehensive test coverage quality

### Performance Testing
- Integrate pytest-benchmark for performance regression testing
- Set up performance baselines and alerts
- Load testing for large codebase analysis
