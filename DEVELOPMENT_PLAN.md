## Phase 2: Testing & Hardening
- [ ] **Testing:** Write unit tests for all feature modules.
- [ ] **Testing:** Add integration tests for the CLI and language-specific generators.
- [ ] **Hardening:** Run security (`bandit`) and quality (`ruff`) scans and fix all reported issues.

## Phase 3: Documentation & Release
- [ ] **Docs:** Create a comprehensive `API_USAGE_GUIDE.md` with endpoint examples.
- [ ] **Docs:** Update `README.md` with final setup and usage instructions.
- [ ] **Release:** Prepare `CHANGELOG.md` and tag the v1.0.0 release.
