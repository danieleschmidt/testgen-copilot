# CI/CD Workflow Files

Due to GitHub App permissions restrictions, the following workflow files could not be committed directly and need to be added manually by the repository owner:

## Files to Add:

### 1. Enhanced CI Workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
The existing CI workflow has been enhanced with:
- Multi-platform testing matrix (Linux, Windows, macOS)
- Security scanning (CodeQL, Bandit, Safety)
- Performance and integration testing
- Docker builds with multi-architecture support
- Automated artifact publishing

### 2. Release Workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)
New automated release pipeline with:
- Semantic versioning validation
- Automated PyPI publishing
- GitHub Container Registry integration
- Release notes generation
- Post-release automation

## Instructions for Repository Owner:

1. **Copy the enhanced CI workflow**:
   ```bash
   # The enhanced ci.yml content is available in the working directory
   # Copy it to .github/workflows/ci.yml
   ```

2. **Add the release workflow**:
   ```bash
   # Copy .github/workflows/release.yml from the working directory
   ```

3. **Configure required secrets**:
   - `PYPI_API_TOKEN`: For PyPI package publishing
   - `TEST_PYPI_API_TOKEN`: For test PyPI publishing
   - `DOCKER_USERNAME` & `DOCKER_PASSWORD`: For Docker Hub (optional)

4. **Enable GitHub features**:
   - Branch protection rules
   - Required status checks
   - Auto-merge for dependabot PRs

## Workflow Features:

### CI Pipeline Enhancements:
- **Quality Gates**: Automated code quality, security, and test coverage checks
- **Matrix Testing**: Python 3.8-3.12 across multiple operating systems
- **Security Scanning**: Comprehensive vulnerability detection
- **Performance Testing**: Benchmark tracking and regression detection
- **Docker Automation**: Multi-architecture container builds

### Release Pipeline Features:
- **Automated Versioning**: Semantic version validation and tagging
- **Package Publishing**: Automated PyPI and container registry uploads
- **Release Notes**: Auto-generated changelogs with commit history
- **Quality Assurance**: Full test suite execution before release
- **Rollback Support**: Safe release process with validation gates

These workflow files complete the CI/CD automation aspect of the comprehensive SDLC implementation.
