# TestGen Copilot Assistant - Architecture Documentation

## System Overview

TestGen Copilot Assistant is a CLI tool and VS Code extension that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically generate comprehensive unit tests and identify security vulnerabilities in codebases.

## Architecture Principles

- **Modularity**: Clear separation of concerns with dedicated modules for parsing, generation, security, and coverage
- **Extensibility**: Plugin-based architecture for supporting multiple languages and testing frameworks
- **Performance**: Efficient AST parsing and caching mechanisms for large codebases
- **Security**: Built-in security scanning with configurable rules and threat detection
- **Quality**: Comprehensive test quality scoring and coverage analysis

## Component Interactions

### 1. Test Generation Pipeline

1. **Input Processing**: CLI accepts source files and configuration
2. **AST Parsing**: `ast_utils.py` parses source code into abstract syntax trees
3. **Code Analysis**: `core.py` analyzes functions, classes, and methods
4. **Test Generation**: `generator.py` creates comprehensive test cases
5. **Quality Assessment**: `quality.py` scores test effectiveness
6. **Output**: Generated tests written to specified directory

### 2. Security Analysis Pipeline

1. **Security Scanning**: `security.py` applies configurable security rules
2. **Vulnerability Detection**: Pattern matching against known vulnerabilities
3. **Risk Assessment**: Severity scoring and categorization
4. **Reporting**: Structured security reports with recommendations

### 3. Coverage Analysis Pipeline

1. **Existing Test Discovery**: Locate and analyze existing test files
2. **Coverage Mapping**: Map test coverage to source code
3. **Gap Analysis**: Identify uncovered functions and branches
4. **Reporting**: Coverage percentages and missing coverage details

## Integration Points

### VS Code Extension
- Language Server Protocol (LSP) integration
- Real-time diagnostics and suggestions
- Command palette integration
- Side panel for test preview and management

### CI/CD Integration
- GitHub Actions workflow integration

## Configuration Architecture

### Configuration Hierarchy
1. Command-line arguments (highest priority)
2. Project-specific `.testgen.config.json`
3. User-specific configuration
4. Default values (lowest priority)

### Configuration Schema
```json
{
  "language": "python|javascript|typescript|java|csharp|go|rust",
  "test_framework": "framework-specific",
  "coverage_target": 0-100,
  "quality_target": 0-100,
  "security_rules": {...},
  "test_patterns": {...},
  "output": {...}
}
```
