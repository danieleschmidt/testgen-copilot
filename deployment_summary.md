## 🔮 QUANTUM CAPABILITIES INCLUDED

### Quantum-Inspired Task Planning
- Task optimization using quantum annealing principles
- Resource allocation with quantum efficiency
- Parallel execution planning
- Dependency resolution with quantum entanglement concepts

### Advanced Algorithms
- Quantum superposition for task states
- Quantum coherence for resource management
