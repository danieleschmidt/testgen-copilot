      label: Proposed Solution
      description: Describe your proposed solution in detail
      placeholder: |
        I propose adding Go language support by:
        1. Creating a Go AST parser
        2. Adding Go-specific test templates
        3. Integrating with Go testing package
        4. Supporting Go modules

        Generated test:
        ```go
        func TestAdd(t *testing.T) {
            result := Add(2, 3)
            assert.Equal(t, 5, result)
